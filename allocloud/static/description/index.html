  <strong>The ALLOcloud-Odoo integration allows to leverage your telephony directly from Odoo.</strong>
</p>
<p>
  Click-to-call, popup notification on incoming call are the basic CTI (Computer Telephony Integration) built-in features.
</p>
<p>
  You can go further by using the Odoo and ALLOcloud APIs and build your own integrations (add calls to the contact activity log, attach call recordings to a specific contact, time call duration for invoicing etc.)
